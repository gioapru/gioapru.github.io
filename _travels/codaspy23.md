This trip was a real mess. [CODASPY23](https://www.codaspy.org/2023/){:target="_blank"} was held in Charlotte, to which there are no flights from ZRH. The best option I found was by making a stop at JFK in New York City. My flight was to depart  from ZRH at 1:30pm and land in JFK at 4:25pm; then, my second flight was to depart at 7:29pm from JFK and land in CLT at 9:49pm. The trip to the hotel should have taken 20 minutes: if everything went smoothly, I **could** have managed to get dinner somewhere---that is, "somewhere" in Charlotte (and not at JFK). Oh, I was so wrong.

Everything went relatively well until I landed in JFK. The flight was 9h long, but I had done it before. After I landed, I was met with a loooong queue at the border control---so long, in fact, that I worried I would not be able to make it for the second flight (~2:30h later). Once I connected to the airport's WiFi, however, I received an canceled]({{ base_path }}/files/travels/codaspy23/first.png){:target="_blank"} from Delta: the second flight was delayed by 40m. Yay! ...or rather, "nay", because this would have meant that my chances of having dinner in Charlotte disappeared completely. 

I waited in line for more than 1h. Then, right after I went through, I received another email. My second flight was [canceled]({{ base_path }}/files/travels/codaspy23/cancel.png){:target="_blank"}, and I was automatically rebooked to another flight---scheduled to depart at 2:59pm of the following day (and land at 5pm). Great! Screw dinner: a no-show to the hotel with no prior warning would have led to a fee. More importantly, however, I had an important (remote) meeting the following day (a Sunday) at 11am, so I **had** to be in my hotel room before that time.     

I went to Delta's customer care, asking for explanations and whether they could put me on another flight---anything that would allow me to reach Charlotte earlier. No dice: everything was already full. Even by making another stop in the USA, there was no way I could reach CLT on that day. There was, however, one solution that enabled me to be in my hotel room within the next day's morning: a flight that departed at 8:10am, and landed at 10:30am in CLT. It was already 6pm, so I took that option. That's when my 13h, overnight stay at JFK began---or, to be precise, when my brain acknowledged that I would have to pass the night there (to be even more precise, in Terminal 4).

At the very least, I was able to have a close one to call the hotel in Charlotte and tell them that I would not come for the first night, which prevented me from being automatically charged.<span class="footnote"><a style="color:firebrick">[a]</a><span class="footnote_content">There was no contact email I could use to contact the hotel. The only way to reach out to them was by phone: however, my SIM card does not allow calls in the USA.</span></span> The other relief was that I would have at least been able to have my meeting (provided that no more cancellations followed). I tried getting information about _why_ I was stranded there: according to some personnel, it was due to bad weather; however, there were flights which were leaving that day, so I truly had no clue. Unfortunately, EU policies do not apply for US domestic flights, meaning that I was going to get no compensation whatsoever for this mishap.

The good news is that I am writing this piece, so I was able to survive that experience. Frankly, however, I do not recommend it to anyone. I was already quite tired: I had many trips the previous days, and I was not able to get much rest on the plane. The idea of having to stay 13h in such a place was annoying---not because of issues such as [uncomfortable "couches"]({{ base_path }}/files/travels/codaspy23/bench.jpg){:target="_blank"}, but rather because of being alone. Indeed, **falling asleep** in an _airport_ when you have _luggage_ is not ideal when there's no one else that can look after your stuff. Had it been with a friend, it may even have ended up being "fun"; but just by myself it was quite bothersome.<span class="footnote"><a style="color:firebrick">[b]</a><span class="footnote_content">I did, however, take the opportunity to try a burger at Shake Shack. I wish I didn't.</span></span>

Nevertheless, my flight the following day was on time and I arrived in my hotel room right when the meeting was starting. 

For the return trip, I also had another delay of ~30m on the first leg to JFK, but it was largely inconsequential---albeit I almost perceived it as a mockery by lady luck, given what I went through for the first trip.
