I didn't want to write a dedicated entry for these trips, but given that the same issues happened back-to-back in the timespan of ~1 week, I decided it was worth doing so.

## Copenhagen

I was going to attend ICWSM'25, in Copenhagen, from June 23rd to June 27th. On the surface, the journey is straightfoward: flights between CPH and ZRH are frequent, direct, and typically last ~1h or so. Of course, things didn't go as expected.

**Reaching CPH.**
My ZRH->CPH flight was supposed to depart at 12:30pm, so I planned to reach ZRH by 10:30; to be precise, my ETA in ZRH was 10:32am (by leaving at 8:17am from Feldkirch, with two changes). Of course, the second train I took had 30m delay, which led me to miss my connecting train, and which resulted in me arriving at ZRH roughly ~1h later. But this is the norm---or, at least, it is if you are used to Italian railways; it shouldn't be when you take trains from SBB, who take pride in their [timeliness/punctuality](https://reporting.sbb.ch/punctuality).<span class="footnote"><a style="color:firebrick">[a]</a><span class="footnote_content">This is not the first time that an SBB train I take is late. Actually, I'd say that I am surprised when an SBB train I take is _not_ late.</span></span> Anyway, I had no issues in going through the security controls and reaching the gate. However, the departure of the flight ended up being delayed by almost 1 hour (56m, to be exact). The reason communicated to us once we got on board was hilarious: "It's raining, so the cargo-loading operations had to be stopped." Yes, SWISS, it makes perfect sense that, in 2025, a flight is delayed by 1h if it rains in Zurich.<span class="footnote"><a style="color:firebrick">[b]</a><span class="footnote_content">I mean, we're in 2025---when it is fairly easy to look at weather forecasts---and SWISS does have ways/processes that ensure that loading luggage onto a flight can be done without it getting wet? Come on!</span></span> 

**Getting back to ZRH.**
The return trip was surreal. The flight was scheduled to depart at 3:05pm. I arrived in CPH with plenty of time to spare---I think I was there at 12:30pm or so. After going through security, I looked at the screen with the list of the flights and... my flight was delayed: 35m, that's what was reported. I began to wait. Then, starting from 12:54pm, every 10m I received a new SMS stating that the scheduled departure was always 10m after the previous communication. It was a true agony ([proof]( {{base_path}}/files/travels/icwsm+ugent25/agony.jpg)). The last one was at 2:24pm, stating that the plane would depart at 4:20pm (which it did). The reason for the delay? "The German fly-space is currently overcrowded, and hence they do not allow us to fly over Germany until this issue has been resolved." Not bad, Swiss, not bad. Oh, and I received an email by SWISS at 4:37pm communicating the gate from which my flight was scheduled to depart from. Yes, at 4:37pm ([proof]( {{base_path}}/files/travels/icwsm+ugent25/gate.jpg)), i.e., 17m after the flight took off. How timely, Swiss!

Hence, all in all, for this trip, I accumulated 140m of "delay" across two flights whose cumulative flying-time was of 150m. Not bad, I would say. Little did I know, however, that an even _worse_ fate would waiting for me just a few days later.


## Bruxelles

Not even one week after my trip to ICWSM'25, I had to go to Belgium as a juror of a PhD defense. This time, my destination airport was that of Brussels (BRU), and the ZRH--BRU flight-time is of 70m. 

**Getting to BRU.**
On July 2nd, my flight to BRU was supposed to depart at 5:55pm. I was supposed to arrive at ZRH at 3:44pm by train. Of course, my train (this one was from OBB, not SBB) was 30m late and I arrived in ZRH at 4:40pm or so. But _of course_ this didn't have any consequence. Why? Because _of course_ my flight had been delayed, too. This time, however, everything appeared to be OK: we got on board without any issues whatsoever. At 5:40 or so, I was sitting on my seat. Then, a member of the crew said in the loudspeaker: "We will depart 1h late because the Brussels airport is not allowing us to land if we were to take off now." Just my luck :)

**Returning to ZRH.**
This trip was just the perfect way to conclude this ordeal. My flight to ZRH was supposed to depart at 3pm, and I arrived at BRU sometime at 1pm. I went past security, and right before I could sit somewhere, I receive an SMS: "Your flight is delayed and will depart at 3:20pm." Alright, not too bad---I mean, after all these delays, what is just 20m? Then, 30m later, another message: "Your flight is delayed and will depart at 4:35pm." I was starting to feel a deja vu from the previous week. But then, at 2:18pm, I receive another SMS "Your flight is delayed and will depart at 3:55pm" ([proof]({{base_path}}/files/travels/icwsm+ugent25/back_in_time.jpg)) ...what? So the flight has recovered some delay? Wonderful!---or so I thought. I reached the gate and began waiting there. At 3:57pm, the screen reporting the details of the flight stated that the scheduled departure time was 3:50pm<span class="footnote"><a style="color:firebrick">[c]</a><span class="footnote_content">Note that 3:50pm was a yet-different time from the one stated in the lsat SMS I received (which reported 3:55pm).</span></span>  Yes, this was shown at 3:57pm ([proof]({{base_path}}/files/travels/icwsm+ugent25/screen.jpg)): very timely, Swiss. Anyway, at 4pm there was no plane attached to the gate. Eventually, the plane arrived at 4:15pm, we began boarding at 4:40pm, and the plane took off at 5:10pm. Why was the plane delayed? "A technical defect in our previous flight forced us to change aircraft, which delayed everything." :) Oh, and upon the landing in ZRH, reaching the terminal took a lot of time because we had to take the bus. Despite my best effort to run from the terminal to the train station (which I did in literally 200 seconds), I was unable to catch my train to go back to Feldkirch (I missed it by 1 minute...<span class="footnote"><a style="color:firebrick">[d]</a><span class="footnote_content">Of course, trains are never late when you need them to be late!</span></span>). 

Overall, for this trip, the accumulated delay was of more than 180m... and the cumulative fly time was of 140m.
