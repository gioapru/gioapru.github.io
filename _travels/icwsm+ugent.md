I didn't want to write a dedicated entry for these trips, but given that the same issues happened back-to-back in the timespan of ~1 week, I decided it was worth doing so.

## Copenhagen

I was going to attend ICWSM'25, in Copenhagen, from June 23rd to June 27th. The journey is straightfoward: flights between CPH and ZRH are frequent, direct, and typically last ~1h or so. Of course, things didn't go as expected.

**Reaching CPH.**
My ZRH->CPH flight was supposed to depart at 12:30pm, so I planned to reach ZRH by 10:30; to be precise, my ETA in ZRH was 10:32 (by leaving at 8:17am from Feldkirch, with two changes). Of course, the second train I took had 30m delay, which led me to miss my connecting train, and which resulted in me arriving at ZRH roughly ~1h later. But this is the norm---or, at least, it is if you are used to Italian railways; it shouldn't be when you take trains from SBB, who are often praised for their timeliness. Anyway, I had no issues in going through the security controls and reaching the gate. However, the departure of the flight ended up being delayed by almost 1 hour (56m, to be exact). The reason communicated to us once we got on board was hilarious: "It's raining, so the loading operations of the baggage had to be stopped." Yes, SWISS, it makes perfect sense that a flight is delayed by 1 if it rains in Zurich. I mean, we're in 2025, and you do not have ways to ensure that loading luggage onto a flight can be done without it getting wet? I mean, come on!

**Getting back to ZRH.**
The return trip was surreal. The flight was scheduled to depart at 3:05pm, and I arrived at CPH with plenty of advance---I think I was there at 12:30pm or so. After going through security, I looked at the screen with the list of the flights and... my flight was delayed: 35m, that's what was reported. I hence began to wait. Then, starting from 12:54pm, every 10m I received a new SMS stating that the scheduled departure was always 10m before the previous communication. It was a true agony ([proof]()). The last one was at 2:24pm, stating that the plane would depart at 4:20pm (which it did). The reason for the delay? "The German fly-space is currently overcrowded, and hence they do not allow us to fly over Germany until this issue has been resolved." Not bad, Swiss, not bad. Oh, and I received an email by SWISS at 4:37pm communicating the gate from which my flight was scheduled to depart from. Yes, at 4:37pm ([proof]()), i.e., 17m after the flight took off. How timely, Swiss!

Hence, all in all, for this trip, I accumulated 140m of "delay" across two flights whose cumulative flying-time was of 150m. Not bad, I would say.


## Bruxelles

Not even one week after my trip to ICWSM'25, I had to go to Belgium as a juror of a PhD defense. This time, my destination airport was that of Bruxelles (BRU), and the ZRH--BRU flight-time is of 70m. 

**Getting to BRU.**
On July 2nd, my flight to BRU was supposed to depart at 5:55pm. I was supposed to arrive at ZRH at 3:44pm by train. Of course, my train (this one was from OBB, not SBB) was 30m late and I arrived in ZRH at 4:40pm or so. But _of course_ this didn't have any consequence. Why? Because _of course_ my flight had been delayed, too. This time, however, everything appeared to be OK: we got on board "when we should have". At 5:40 or so, I was sitting on my seat. Then, a member of the crew said in the loudspeaker: "We will depart 1h late because the Bruxelles airport is not allowing us to land if we were to take off now." Just my luck :)

**Returning to ZRH.**
This trip was just the perfect way to conclude this ordeal. My flight was supposed to depart at 3pm, and I arrived at BRU sometime at 1pm. I went past security, and right before I could sit somewhere, I receive an SMS: "Your flight will depart at 3:20pm instead of than at 3:00pm." Alright, not too bad---I mean, after all these delays, what is just 20m? Then, 30m later, another message: "Your flight will depart at 4:35pm instead of than at 3:00pm." I was starting to feel a deja vu from the previous week. But then, at 2:18pm, I receive another SMS "Your flight will depart at 3:55pm instead of than at 3:00pm" [proof()] what? So the delay has gone down? Wonderful!---or so I thought. I then reached the gate and began waiting there. At 3:57pm, the screen reporting the details of the flight still stated that the scheduled departure time was 3:50pm ([proof]()---very timely, Swiss!). At 4pm, there was no plane attached to the gate. Eventually, the plane arrived at 4:15pm, we began boarding at 4:40pm, and the plane took off at 5:10pm. Why was the plane delayed? "A technical defect in our previous flight forced us to change aircraft, which delayed everything." :) Oh, and upon the landing in ZRH, reaching the terminal took a lot of time because we had to take the bus. Despite my best effort to run from the terminal to the train station (which I did in literally 200 seconds), I was unable to catch my train to go back to Feldkirch (I missed it by 1 minute... of course, trains are never late when I need them to be late...). 

Overall, for this trip, the accumulated delay was of more than 180m... and the cumulative fly time was of 140m.
