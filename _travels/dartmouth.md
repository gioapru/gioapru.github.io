I am writing this "story" in October 2024---more than 5 years after what happened in January 2019. And yet, everything is still so fresh in my memory. I could still feel the agony that I experienced during that fateful day.

## Preparations

But let's go in order. In 2019, I lived (and was pursuing my PhD) in Modena. Thanks to my advisor, I was accepted to spend 6 months as a visiting scholar at Dartmouth College, Hanover, New Hampshire, USA. Getting the J1 VISA to go to Dartmouth took a lot of effort; and, moreover, I also spent a lot of time in finding a proper place I could stay in<span class="footnote"><a style="color:firebrick">[a]</a><span class="footnote_content">Most people I know of who did research visits in US institutions typically spent the first weeks in AirBnBs just for finding rooms/apartments, because most landlords want to see the tenants in person, or maybe require the tenant to have a social security number---which most non-US residents do not have.</span></span> for the entire 6 months---all of these ordeals will not be described here. Regardless, my journey was to begin on the 19th of January 2019. My destination: Wilder, i.e., a remote town of ~100 inhabitants in Vermont, around 10km from Dartmouth College (that was the best place I could find). Reaching Wilder from Modena was not simple, and the itinerary was the following:
* first, my mother was to bring me to Bologna's airport. The nearest airport to Wilder is Boston, but there are no direct flights to Boston from Bologna. So I had to make an intermediate stop at Paris Charles de Gaulle (CDG). 
* My flight from BLQ to CDG was at 7am, and it was supposed to land at 9am. Then, I had several hours to wait, and my connecting flight to Boston was supposed to land at 5:35pm (local time).
* To reach Wilder from Boston's airport, there is a coach, called "Dartmouth Coach", which stops at Dartmouth College. On the day of my arrival, the last coaches were at 6:50pm and 8:50pm. I deliberately chose a flight that would land early enough to safely enable me to get the 8pm coach.
* Finally, to reach my house in Wilder from Dartmouth College, I made a deal with my landlord: he asked one of the other tenants of the house I was supposed to live in to come pick me up with his car at Dartmouth College.

As you can see, the trip was not simple. However, as I wrote, I was meticulous and had everything planned. But, of course, the simple fact that you're reading this piece means that something did not go as expected.

## Saturday, January 19, 2019

The day of the departure I could not sleep. There were simply too many things in my head: did I take everything? Did I miss anything? What about X / Y / Z? Who cares about sleeping anyway: I have a very long travel ahead, and I'll have plenty of time to sleep on the plane. I was so wrong.

### Snowstorm

Among the millions of thoughts I had, I decided that I wanted to find out "where" the Dartmouth Coach was supposed to depart from: I had already been at the Boston Logan's airport, but I never took this coach. So, just to be prepared, I began investigating. I went to the website of the coach (I already had a ticket), [www.dartmouthcoach.com](www.dartmouthcoach.com), and began looking for information. I was doing this search at around 2am (CET), i.e., 4 hours before I was to leave with my mother for Bologna's airport. This is when I made a very bad discovery. Apparently, due to a heavy snowstorm, the Dartmouth Coach scheduled for 8:50pm on Saturday January 19 was canceled. The next coach was planned to run on Monday, January 21, at 8am. **What?** Wait, my plane lands at 5:35pm, and this means I only have the coach of 6:50pm that I can take. 

Still, there was little I could do---besides hoping that "things would go well". Just to be on the safe side, however, I sent a message to my landlord, telling him that my ETA was 2 hours earlier (since my plan was to take the 8:50pm coach, given that I deemed the 6:50pm coach to be very tough to take), and that I would keep him informed about my whereabouts: the last thing I wanted was to wait for 2 hours in a snowstorm, in the night, in a place I had never been to before. 

### Arriving in Boston

Eventually, I reached the Bologna airport, took my flight to CDG, and then got onto my flight to Boston. That's when I began to "hope" -- hope that the flight is going to be on time, and that I could get out of border control in time for the 6:50pm coach. Of course, I could not sleep at all.

My plane landed in Boston with a slight delay (15m). However, I am quite fast and manage to get out of the plane relatively quickly. I arrive at the passport control and there is almost no one there: at 6:00pm, I am past the controls. I take a deep breath: I would make it. But then I realised that there was something I did not take into account: my luggage.

I had two checked-in luggage.<span class="footnote"><a style="color:firebrick">[b]</a><span class="footnote_content">After all, I was to stay in the US for 6 months---the first two being in Winter; and Winter in New England is harsh. So I had a lot of heavy clothes.</span></span> When I got out from the passport control, the baggage carousel used to deliver checked-in luggage was not moving yet. Put simply, my efforts at being among the first to go through passport control had been meaningless, given this "bottleneck" of the checked-in luggage. 

### Unbearable wait

I began to wait. 6:10. 6:15. At 6:20, the carousel began moving, and the first luggage came out. No sight of my luggage, though. 6:25, 6:30. _Heck, the Dartmouth Coach leaves in 20 minutes!_ 6:35. 6:40. That's when I see one of my luggage! I promptly get it, hoping to see my other luggage soon. But I was wrong. At 6:45, I began to think: _should I go out now, and forgo my second luggage? But even assuming I go out like this, will I make it in 5 minutes? And even if I make it, what about my luggage? I should come back here---they would definitely not send it to me, unless it was "lost". Dayum._

I didn't leave. I stood there. At 6:53pm, my second luggage came out. I took it and began to run---to this date, I still have no idea "how" I actually ran, given that I had 2 large luggage with wheels, and a hand-luggage (also with wheels) as well as my backpack and a very large coat. Regardless, I went outside, and took a look. Somewhere, in the distance, around 200m away from me, I could see a coach with "Dartmouth" written on the side, and someone attempting to close the luggage compartment. I began running and shouting "heyyyyy!!". I manage to get that person's attention. When I arrive, I can barely speak. He utters something---something which I do not understand. But I say "Is this the Dartmouth Coach?". He says something---probably a "yes", but I don't really know. "I need to go to Dartmouth" I say. Again, he says something and then opens the luggage compartment again. I put my luggage inside, then tell him I have a ticket (and show it), and get inside. I couldn't believe it... but things were not over yet.

### Snow tires

I sat on an empty seat. There were not many people inside. Luckily, there was Wi-Fi on the coach (I knew this---it was stated in the website). So I send a message to my mother, telling her that I managed to get the coach (she was well-aware of the issues I was going through). Then, I send a message to my landlord. "I made it! I am on the 6:50pm coach. My ETA at Dartmouth is 10pm". After some minutes, I get a response. "Hi Giovanni. Unfortunately, due to the snowstorm, the person who was supposed to come pick you up could not come bacause they do not have snow tires on their car". **What?** What the heck was I supposed to do, then? I was on a coach that was getting into the middle of nowhere, and that was supposed to leave me in the middle of a snowstorm in a place I was completely oblivious of. 

I send a few more messages with my landlord, and he eventually recommended me to use "Uber". Now, I knew what Uber was, but I had never used it before (remember, it was still 2019). I download the Uber app and register an account (thanks to the WiFi of the coach...). I look for available cars, and I found that there is _one_ Uber driver available---in the middle of the snowstorm! I book him for a drive from Dartmouth College to Wilder, and he accepts! When the coach reaches its final destination, my Uber driver was there. I could not believe it again. I thanked the guy---had he not been there, I really had (or have right now) no idea of what I would have done.

### Happy ending

I reached my house sometime after 10:20pm. The tenants were very welcoming. However, I soon found out of another "issue": the room I was supposed to stay in was not free yet. Apparently, the guy using it extended his stay and... well, I had to use a temporary room for a few days. After all that I had been through, this was definitely... negligible. I was in a house---and not outside, in a snowstorm. Unfortunately, I learned that there was no place that could sell any sort of food in a radius of 5km from the house, and there were no public transportation running on Sunday. This meant that I had nothing to eat (aside from a few slices of bread that I brought with me) for the first day. Thankfully, the other tenants gave me something, for which I was deeply grateful.
