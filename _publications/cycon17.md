<b>Abstract.</b> Detecting advanced attacks is increasingly complex and no single solution can
work. Defenders can leverage logs and alarms produced by network and security devices, but
big data analytics solutions are necessary to transform huge volumes of raw data into useful
information. Existing anomaly detection frameworks either work offline or aim to mark a host
as compromised, with high risk of false alarms. We propose a novel online approach that
monitors the behavior of each internal host, detects suspicious activities possibly related to
advanced attacks, and correlates these anomaly indicators to produce a list of the most likely
compromised hosts that is provided to human analysts. Due to the huge number of devices
and traffic logs, we make scalability one of our top priorities. Therefore, most computations
are independent on the number of hosts and can be naively parallelized. A large set of
experiments demonstrate that our proposal can pave the way to novel forms of detection of
advanced malware.
