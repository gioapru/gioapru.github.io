<b>Abstract.</b> Video games are becoming increasingly popular in research, and abundant prior work has investigated this domain by means of _user studies_. However, carrying out user studies whose population encompasses a large and diverse set of participants is challenging. Crowdsourcing platforms, such as Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT), represent a cost-effective solution to address this problem. Yet, prior efforts scrutinizing the data-quality (unrelated to gaming) collected via AMT raises a concern: is AMT reliable for game studies? 

In this paper, we are the first to tackle this question. We carry out three user studies (n=302) through which we evaluate the overall validity of the responses---pertaining to 14 popular video games---we received via AMT. We adopt strict verification mechanisms, which are trivial to "bypass" by real gamers, but costly for non-gamers. We found that the percentage of valid responses ranges from 5% (for WoW) to 28% (for PUBG). We hence advocate future research to carefully scrutinize the validity of responses collected via AMT.
