Hello and welcome to my personal website! I am an **Assistant Professor** at the University of Liechtenstein, where I currently teach some fundamentals of Computer Science, such as programming, networking and cybersecurity. 

As a **researcher**, my primary interests lie at the intersection of cybersecurity and data analytics, with a specific focus on networking, phishing, machine learning, and adversarial machine learning. I can proudly state that I have publications tackling all of such subjects, but I like exploring new areas. 

Whenever I am not teaching or "researching" (whatever it means), I enjoy pursuing diverse hobbies. Oddly enough, one of such hobbies is **reviewing**: I've reviewed more than 200 papers since 2020 (not counting "revisions"). I have _never_ missed a single deadline; on average, my reviews contain 6491 letters and 1033 words. I consider peer-reviewing to be the backbone of research, and will do all I can to improve the work of other researchers (including championing papers and disagreeing with other reviewers---if necessary). 

Aside from being a passionate reviewer, I am also: a nerd, a geek, a very active person, and someone who loves communication and social interactions.
* **Nerd**: I regularly play _Dungeons and Dragons_ (both as a Dungeon Master and as a Player); I love playing _videogames_ (I was once a competitive gamer, with some success stories to tell about!); and also love immersing myself in complex pieces of *fiction* (in any format).
* **Geek**: I love IT and I have dozens of _connected_ devices in my house---managing all of them is becoming tougher, though (what is a _pihole_?). However, I will hardly use devices of which I do not have _root_ rights (admin power!). 
* **Active**: during my first two years in Liechtenstein, I used my car only 10 times to commute; in contrast, I biked "outdoor" for over 5 thousands kilometers (irrespective of sun/snow/rain, cold/hot, night/day), and "indoor" for over 30 thousands kilometers. 
* **Social**: I love exploring the ins-and-outs of (some parts of) our World; unfortunately I can only do so from my perspective, which is ultimately insignificant. Without actively engaging with other (human) beings, my life would be extremely boring, and I would not be where I am. I am glad of having collaborated with many wonderful people in the past, and I am constantly trying to expand my network.  

Do you have anything you'd like to talk about? Feel free to contact me!
