Hello and welcome to my personal website! I am an **Assistant Professor** at Reykjavik University (and also at the University of Liechtenstein), where I currently teach subjects within the Computer Science domain, such as programming, networking, deep learning, and cybersecurity. 

As a **researcher**, my primary interests lie at the intersection of cybersecurity and data analytics, with a specific focus on networking, phishing, machine learning, and adversarial machine learning. I can proudly state that I have publications tackling all of such subjects, but I like exploring new areas. For instance, since 2022, I have begun exploring the field of human-computer interaction, as well as that of metascience (typically, by assuming either a security or a machine-learning perspective).

Whenever I am not teaching or "researching" (whatever it means), I enjoy pursuing diverse hobbies. Oddly enough, one of such hobbies is **reviewing**: I've reviewed more than 500 papers since 2020 (you can find more stats [here]({{ base_path }}/reviewing)) and I've _never_ missed a single deadline. I consider peer-reviewing to be the backbone of research, and will do all I can to improve the work of other researchers (including championing papers and disagreeing with other reviewers---if necessary). Currently, one of my primary research interests is addressing the problem of "illegitimate" usage of LLMs in peer-review contexts. 

Aside from being a passionate reviewer, I am also: a nerd, a geek, a very active person, and someone who loves communication and social interactions.
* **Nerd**: I regularly play _Dungeons and Dragons_ (both as a Dungeon Master and as a Player); I enjoy playing _videogames_ (I was once a competitive gamer, with some success stories to tell about!); and also love immersing myself in complex pieces of *fiction* (in any format).
* **Geek**: I am passionate towards IT and I have dozens of _connected_ devices in my house---managing all of them is becoming tougher, though (what is a _pihole_?). However, I will hardly use devices of which I do not have _root_ rights (admin power!). 
* **Active**: during my four years in Liechtenstein, I used my car only 10 times to commute (despite living ~14km away from the University); I always go there by bike (irrespective of sun/snow/rain, cold/hot, night/day). I also cycle indoor---even while working (on average, I "ride a bike" for 60km on a daily basis). 
* **Social**: Without actively engaging with other (human) beings, my life would be extremely boring, and I would not be where I am. I am glad of having collaborated with many wonderful people in the past, and I am constantly trying to expand my network.   

Do you have anything you'd like to talk about? Feel free to contact me!
