(last update: 09 January 2024) **UNDER CONSTRUCTION**

I am currently returning from the [HICSS-57](https://hicss.hawaii.edu/program-hicss57/){:target="_blank"} conference, sitting on a plane whose departure had been delayed by 160 minutes.<span class="footnote"><a style="color:firebrick">[a]</a><span class="footnote_content">Due to "Aircraft Rotation" (?)</span></span>I am writing this post to "collect" all the misfortunes I encountered while travelling for academic reasons. Indeed, while I consider myself to be extremely lucky to have had the opportunity to attend many events, the reverse side of the coin is that the wide majority of my work trips concealed some unexpected events.<span class="footnote"><a style="color:firebrick">[b]</a><span class="footnote_content">It is not surprising that most people whom I told the "stories" written in this post typically come to the conclusion that they should "stay far-away from me when planning a trip somewhere"!</span></span> 

## Disclaimer

For obvious reasons, I will omit most privacy-sensitive details. Also, this is not an attempt to point the finger at any specific entity (aside from my "bad luck"): I am well-aware that problems "happens". Of course, the best way to stop these problems from affecting me is to stop traveling altogether---which is not something on my radar.

## Foreword

One of the major perks (which I was totally unaware of when I began my PhD) of the academic life is the possibility of _traveling_. Of course, this possibility is not exempt from caveats: to travel, you must have a _reason_ (e.g., you must present a paper; or a certain entity invites you to a given event); and to have such a reason, you must be "lucky" <span class="footnote"><a style="color:firebrick">[c]</a><span class="footnote_content">Some people would say "successful" rather than "lucky". However, after 8 years in this sphere, I have _reason_ to believe that luck plays a huge role in determining an academic's success</span></span> (you must have a paper accepted _and_ the funds to cover the expenses);<span class="footnote"><a style="color:firebrick">[d]</a><span class="footnote_content">For EU-based individuals, such expenses can easily reach 2kâ‚¬ for events in the EU, and exceed 3K for those in the USA.</span></span>and to be invited somewhere you must have obtained a certain degree of "recognition" _or_ have "allies" who strongly believe in you.

In my case, I was lucky enough to be given the chance of traveling (arguably) _a lot_. Evidence of this is my [talk map](https://www.giovanniapruzzese.com/talkmap.html). Yet, despite being a fascinating opportunity, traveling also has some downsides. For instance, from the perspective of "productivity", you will hardly output more results than what you'd produce in your regular setup. Then, there is "bureaucracy", which entails either the filing of reports _before_ the events (potentially including the request to receive some funding), as well as for those _after_ the event (summarising the expenses for which you request reimbursement).<span class="footnote"><a style="color:firebrick">[e]</a><span class="footnote_content">Of course, one can always put themselves on holiday and pay everything by himself; but would hardly be sustainable.</span></span> Finally, there is "logistics": even when the expenses are covered, the selection of the (i) lodging and (ii) itinerary and corresponding (iii) means of transportation falls on yourself---and this also includes handling any potential "issue" that may arise during your journey.

This "diary" is an attempt to reflect on all such occurrences---after all, whatever doesn't kill us... is a tale to be told!<span class="footnote"><a style="color:firebrick">[f]</a><span class="footnote_content">I point out that, when writing the summary of a given [talk]({{ base_path }}/files/talks) in my website, I describe the circumstances that led to the talk. Hence, there may be some overlap between what is stated here, and in some of my talk-summaries.</span></span>

## Collection

Before I begin, let me summarize the various steps of any given trip---each potentially being the source of the "issue".

Of course, the "simplest" trips are those for which I used my car, or the train: the former are straightforward, whereas the latter only require me reaching the train station. In contrast, trips that entail a flight are much more complex, since they require: 

* going from my home to the airport;<span class="footnote"><a style="color:firebrick">[g]</a><span class="footnote_content">This is not trivial: when I lived in Italy, the airport was typically BLQ (I lived in Modena) which I reached by car (it was a 40m drive, and the parking was quite cheap); now that I live in Feldkirch, the airport is typically ZRH, which I reach by train (it's a 2h journey with one change).</span></span> 
* taking the plane, and arriving to the destination airport;<span class="footnote"><a style="color:firebrick">[h]</a><span class="footnote_content">Occasionally, this may require a stop to an intermediate airport---which, if done in the USA/Canada, also necessitates passing through border control.</span></span>
* Going from the airport to the hotel.<span class="footnote"><a style="color:firebrick">[i]</a><span class="footnote_content">This is also not trivial: in some cases, a taxi is all I need; in others, I may have to take a train.</span></span>
* The same thing in reverse for the return trip.<span class="footnote"><a style="color:firebrick">[j]</a><span class="footnote_content">It is likely that, for the return trip, I am considerably more tired than for the initial trip.</span></span>

The biggest issue with trips requiring a flight is that, due to their complexity, things can go wrong in many "elements". For instance, any disruption on my way to the airport may lead to me missing my flight. To avoid this, I tend to leave very early, keeping ample time of "buffer".

In what follows, I will list all the trips for which I had any "issue". Clicking on the corresponding trip will bring to a page describing what transpired.

### 2024

* [HICSS-57](tbd) (Jan. 2024)

### 2023

I had no issues for my seminar talk at EPFL (in Lausanne) and for my trip to EuroS&P'23. In contrast, I had various issues for the following trips:

* [eCrime'23](tbd) (Nov. 2023)
* [ESORICS'23](tbd) (Sep. 2023)
* [CODASPY'24](tbd) (Apr. 2023)
* [SaTML'23](tbd) (Feb. 2023)

### 2022

I had no issues for EuroS&P'22 and for Dagstuhl: in both cases, I used my car and, besides some road traffic, the trip went OK. However, I had various issues for the following trips:

* [ACSAC'22](tbd) (Dec. 2022)
* [UniPD](tbd) (Nov. 2022)
* [S&P'22](tbd) (May 2022)
* [TU Delft](tbd) (May 2022)

### 2021 & older

Due to the COVID pandemic, there have been no "physical" events that I attended during 2021 and 2020. Before, my trips were "stressful" for reasons that were unrelated to the journey itself (e.g., for NCA'18, I was stressed because it was the first conference that I attended to present my own work). There is only one trip that warrants a post: [Dartmouth](tbd).
