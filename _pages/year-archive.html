<p style="font-size: 80%">I love writing. At times, I look back at my own life and scrutinize my previous decisionsâ€”and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtIzMaLkCaM" target="blank">writing helps us to think</a>.
<br>Other times, however, I just want to reflect on some problems that affect my daily life.</p>

<span style="font-size: 60%">Although most of these posts are for myself, I would be glad if other people found my ramblings to be of interest!</span>
