I am currently returning from the [HICSS-57](https://hicss.hawaii.edu/program-hicss57/){:target="_blank"} conference, sitting on a plane whose departure had been delayed by 160 minutes.<span class="footnote"><a style="color:firebrick">[a]</a><span class="footnote_content">Due to "Aircraft Rotation" (?)</span></span> I have decided to write a diary collecting all the "misfortunes" I encountered while travelling for academic reasons. 

Indeed, while I consider myself to be extremely lucky to have had the opportunity to attend many events, the reverse side of the coin is that the wide majority of my work trips concealed some unexpected complications. For some reason, Giovanni Apruzzese is found to be very attractive by these "unexpected complications".<span class="footnote"><a style="color:firebrick">[b]</a><span class="footnote_content">It is not surprising that most people whom I tell my “traveling stories” typically conclude that they should “stay far away from me when planning a trip somewhere”!</span></span> 

You can see the diary [here]({{ base_path }}/travels).
