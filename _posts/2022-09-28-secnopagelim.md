This post discusses some of my (personal!) viewpoints on why having more venues with "unlimited" pages for _references_ and _appendices_ can improve the current peer-review process. For reference (pun intendedâ˜º), I invite you to look at this website, which I created a few hours ago: [SecNoPageLim](https://secnopagelim.github.io/) 



### Backstory

The [SecNoPageLim](https://secnopagelim.github.io/)  website was inspired by the "Rump Session" held during the 2022 edition of the [IEEE European Symposium on Security and Privacy](https://www.ieee-security.org/TC/EuroSP2022/program.html) (held on Wednesday, June 8th, 2022).

In particular, during such Rump Session, I gave a talk revolving about the length of papers in Cybersecurity Conferences. Funnily enough, [David Evans](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/) (the Co-chair of EuroS&P22) said that "the ideal length of a paper is 0 pages", which is something to which I agree with---in principle. Yet, the discussion was very engaging (I believe it lasted nearly 1 hour), and a lot of interesting points were raised by all the participants (h/t to all those who contributed!).

In what follows, you will find what is---in a sense---a summary of the discussion that transpired during the Rump Session at EuroS&P22, which is further enriched with my own viewpoints.

### My viewpoint

Let me elucidate the reasons why I believe that both **references** and **appendices** should be unlimited. I will separately address each of these, providing my perspective both as an "author" (i.e., as one who _writes_ a paper) and as a "reviewer" (i.e., the one who _reads_ and _evaluates_ a paper).


#### Appendices
Research in cybersecurity---and in computer science in general---is becoming increasingly more demanding. Finding "novelty" requires to reproduce prior work, sometimes by developing _original code_, or by creating _ad-hoc datasets_, or perhaps a mix of both. All such operations (i) require intensive _human effort_ and (ii) are very _lengthy to describe_ in a paper, but (iii) are **not a contribution**. Hence, what should an author do?

* Skip them!
  * But what about reproducibility and transparency?  
* Describe them in the main paper!
  * Unfortunately, the main paper is subject to _page limitations_.
* Describe them in the artifact (if envisioned in the venue)!
  * Unfortunately, the artifact is (typically) evaluated _after_ a decision on the paper has been made.
* Provide a link to an (anonymous) repository/resource that includes all such information!
  * Would the reviewers read it? Most reviewers print the paper on hard-paper, and unless they were made aware of such "extra" resources, such information would not be included in the printed paper

A (possible) solution to all the above is by removing the limit to the length of _appendices_ that can be included in a paper---at least at the time of submission. The idea is providing a "shield" to authors, so that they can focus on describing their main contribution while transparently providing all technical details related to a given implementation (or a theoretical proof). At the same time, reviewers **can** inspect such details---if they believe it necessary; or, at the very least, they should not state that "the paper does not provide enough details" in their reviews. 

As an **author** it is disappointing:
* when you have to "cut" some technical details simply because the page limits do not allow you to do it feasibly---and then seeing your paper "rejected" because of "lack of details";
* when your paper is "rejected" because a reviewer complained about the "lack of details", despite such details being included in the Appendix.

(both circumstances happened to me, and it was incredibly frustrating)

As a **reviewer**, however, I acknowledge that it is discouraging when you open a paper and you see 30 pages (in a DC template), 15 of which being of Appendices... and even more-so when such appendices include content outside your main area of expertise.
The reviewer, however, _can skip the appendix_: in this case, the reviewer should---_before_ submitting their review---check if some shortcomings outlined in their review are addressed in the appendix. If this is true, then the reviewer can either:
* read the corresponding part of the appendix, and check its correctness (perhaps the reviewer was genuinely interested in having a question answered!);
* remove the shortcoming, which would be unfounded;
* fairly state that the shortcoming may be unfounded by admitting that it may have been discussed in the Appendix, which the reviewer did not fully read---either for lack of time, or domain expertise.

(I always do one of the above when I review a paper)

#### References

The amount of papers that are accepted every day is constantly increasing (see [here](http://jianying.space/conference-ranking.html) for some trends). For instance, the amount of papers accepted at IEEE S&P was 147 in 2022, 55 in 2015, and 17 in 2005.
Such abundance implicitly leads to _more related work_, which should be discussed---and cited---in any given paper. And such citations "take space". 

As an **author**, it is discouraging when a reviewer criticizes the lack of "crucial references" when you were fully aware of their relevance, but which you did not include because you did not have the space for them. (on a personal note, I do not understand why some venues accept SoK papers, but impose limits on the length of references.)

As a **reviewer**, it may appear daunting to look at a paper and see hundreds of references. However --- personally --- I believe that this is a "fake" issue: a reviewer should not look at the references, but at the main text. Then, on the basis of where (and how) such references are used in the text, a comment can be made.

#### Takeaway

Simply put, I believe that there is much to gain by having more venues to accept papers with "unlimited" references and appendices. I acknowledge that some venues may have constraints due to their editorial proceedings: in these cases, however, it is still possible to impose a constraint only for the final version of the paper (this is what is done, e.g., by USENIX Security). 

Bottom line: the purpose is to improve the _peer-review_. This solution is obviously not perfect, but (IMHO) it is a step towards a more constructive and fair peer-review process.
