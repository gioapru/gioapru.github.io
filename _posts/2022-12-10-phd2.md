This is the _second_ in a series of post in which I reflect on some milestones of my own life.  

"**Why doing this**", one may ask.
* For _myself_, because I like to look back at my own life and scrutinize my previous decisions.
* For _others_, because someone else may draw some inspiration from the stories I will narrate.  

### Disclaimer
At the moment of writing, I have no idea of how to structure all such "stories" -- so, I must warn the reader that whatever they will read may be subject to change, and may even be incomprehensible if one is not familiar with my persona.

# Introduction

After having lived for 31 years, 3 months and 9 days, it is difficult to determine _which decision **I made**_ had the greatest impact on **my** life. Yet, I find that going for a PhD was among the most significant ones. In what follows, I will attempt to summarize, contextualize and justify the reasons that made me opt for this path. <span class="footnote"><a href="#" style="color:firebrick">[a]</a><span class="footnote_content"> SPOILER: after reading many blogs of other renowned scientists and researchers, I can safely state that my reasons are much different from anyone else's---and by a huge margin.</span></span>

To this purpose, however, I must first provide some background on myself. Starting from when I began my BSc. <span class="footnote"><a href="#" style="color:firebrick">[b]</a><span class="footnote_content"> WARNING: the following content can be rather sensitive.)</span></span>
