<p>A Github Pages template for academic websites. This was forked (then detached) by <a href="https://github.com/staeiou">Stuart Geiger</a> from the <a href="https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/">Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme</a>, which is Â© 2016 Michael Rose and released under the MIT License. See LICENSE.md.</p>
<p>I think I've got things running smoothly and fixed some major bugs, but feel free to file issues or make pull requests if you want to improve the generic template / theme.</p>

<li>Set site-wide configuration and create content &amp; metadata (see below -- also see <a href="http://archive.is/3TPas">this set of diffs</a> showing what files were changed to set up <a href="https://getorg-testacct.github.io">an example site</a> for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")</li>
<li>Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  </li>

<h1 id="changelog-bugfixes-and-enhancements">Changelog -- bugfixes and enhancements</h1>
<p>There is one logistical issue with a ready-to-fork template theme like academic pages that makes it a little tricky to get bug fixes and updates to the core theme. If you fork this repository, customize it, then pull again, you'll probably get merge conflicts. If you want to save your various .yml configuration files and markdown files, you can delete the repository and fork it again. Or you can manually patch. </p>
<p>To support this, all changes to the underlying code appear as a closed issue with the tag 'code change' -- get the list <a href="https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/issues?q=is%3Aclosed%20is%3Aissue%20label%3A%22code%20change%22%20">here</a>. Each issue thread includes a comment linking to the single commit or a diff across multiple commits, so those with forked repositories can easily identify what they need to patch.</p>
