This was the first time I attended a research-oriented and game-related conference. Actually, this holds true in the general sense: despite my passion for games, I never attended any conference on video games (such as, e.g., the Games Week). Hence, I was super curious and excited to have the opportunity to present a paper at the IEEE Conference on Games (CoG).

However, this was also the first time that I partake in a "duo" presentation. Indeed, I was not alone to present our work: the first author, Linus Eisele, was there and did a marvelous job at describing the key points of our contribution. This may sound biased, but I think that Linus' presentation skills are outstanding for a MSc. student.

That aside, I had a great time at IEEE CoG. Actually, something that I found surprising was the number of questions that the audience asked to every speaker: I did not recall a single talk for which the session chair did not say "unfortunately we have to move on with the next speaker". This is in contrast with many security-focused conferences that I attended recently (I do have some hypotheses for this, but I won't list them here).
