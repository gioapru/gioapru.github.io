I really had a blast at Dagstuhl---definitely one of those "once in a lifetime" experiences. In particular, during the second day of the Seminar, there was a session entirely devoted to "negative results". 

Here, I let out a lot of negativity that I experienced during my first 2 years as a postdoc---negativity concealing a problem that (imho) is significantly affecting our community as whole.

<b>Abstract:</b> In this (informal!) talk, I will discuss about the pros and cons of (re)using “benchmark” datasets in the context of ML security. I will elucidate some aspects  deriving from such “reuse”  that intrinsically affect our entire community. My intention is to raise the attention to a “problem” that – despite being at the core of our research – is often overlooked, and that (potentially) is negatively impacting future developments in our domain.
