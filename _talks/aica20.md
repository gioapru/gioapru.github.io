Autonomous Intelligent Cyber Agents -- AICA in short -- will rely on ML but will also be deployed in adversarial settings. Hence, they will undeniably be targeted by cyber attacks. In my talk, I will show (i) how AICA can be attacked, (ii) what are the limitations of existing work, and (iii) where should we act to improve the resilience of AICA?
