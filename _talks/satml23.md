I do not know where to begin in describing how satisfactory it was to work on this paper---and giving the corresponding talk. 

Of one thing, however, I am certain---which I tried my best to convey during its presentation: the paper does not have "only" 6 authors. Indeed, this paper was only possible because of the [Dagstuhl Seminar](https://www.dagstuhl.de/en/seminars/seminar-calendar/seminar-details/22281) on "Security of Machine Learning", held in July 2022, which most authors participated to (I met most of them there for the first time!).

We wrote a 26-pages--long (position) paper in just 1 month, but doing so was both _pleasing_ and _easy_: the majority of our takeaways derived from the passionate discussions that we all had during the Dagstuhl Seminar. Once again, I am extremely grateful for having participated to such an event (and, for this, I will be forever thankful to the organizers).

### Follow-up

This work apparently was well-received by our community (and this makes me all-the-more happy), to the point that several follow-up talks/webinars were given to further explore some of the themes tackled by the paper. Such events include:

* A webinar involving four of the paper's authors, organized by [Robust Intelligence](https://us06web.zoom.us/webinar/register/9716757880895/WN_b5VZdl8jQ4uMJzDTe0y1LQ) (the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZQli55AKwQ) is available)
* A talk I gave at a research seminar at the [SPRING Lab](https://spring.epfl.ch/research/) at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/)
* A [webinar](https://calendar.und.edu/event/c2srair_initiative_-_virtual_colloquia_series_on_cybersecurity_and_artificial_intelligence_7121){:target="_blank"} I gave at the University of North Dakota (video [available](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxvmNlddPoE){:target="_blank"})
