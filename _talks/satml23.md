I do not know where to begin in describing how satisfactory it was to work on this paper---and giving the corresponding talk. 

Of one thing, however, I am certain---which I tried my best to convey during its presentation: the paper does not have "only" 6 authors. Indeed, this paper was only possible because of the [Dagstuhl Seminar]({{ base_path }}/talks/dagstuhl22) on "Security of Machine Learning", held in July 2022 and, which most authors participated to (I met most of them there for the first time!).

We wrote a 26-pages--long (position) paper in just 1 month, but doing so was both _pleasing_ and _easy_: the majority of our takeaways derived from the passionate discussions that we all had during the Dagstuhl Seminar. Once again, I am extremely grateful for having participated to such an event (and, for this, I will be forever thankful to the organizers).
