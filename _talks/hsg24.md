Phishing websites are everywhere. This fact may come at a surprise when considering the thousands of papers proposing artificial-intelligence (AI) techniques to counter this threat. Some of these techniques "work", i.e., they can reliably detect phishing websites---which is clearly an encouraging result. However, many "state-of-the-art" AI methods can also be trivially fooled with little effort by naive attackers---which is clearly a disheartening result. Finally, AI methods can also be offensively used by attackers to circumvent AI-based detectors---which is clearly a worrying result.

In this talk, I will explore these three complementary classes of results, each denoting a different "face" of AI. Specifically, I will explain on how AI can be used to catch phish. Then, I will show how to trivially evade these AI-based methods with simple modifications that anyone could do. Finally, I will reveal more sophisticated---but still affordable---ways to maliciously use AI tools to circumvent phishing detectors powered by AI. During this journey I will also emphasize the role of the end-user: ultimately, a phishing website must deceive a human---not an AI.
