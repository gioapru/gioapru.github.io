It was nice to attend EuroS&P for the second year in a row. Compared to the previous edition, in Genoa, which was held in a 5-star Hotel and whose social dinner was in an historical building, this edition was much more "sober": it was held at TU Delft (the room was amazing, it looked like a Cinema!), and the social dinner was at a restaurant with a much more "normal" vibe (albeit the picture with me in a Dutch attire was quite funny!). Yet, from a purely "research" perspective, I felt that the conference to be slightly better than the previous edition. Particularly, the quality of the talks was outstanding: I chaired the "Machine Learning Security" session and the three talks were extremely interesting---so much that the audience kept asking questions and it was "hard" to stop them!

As for my talk, I will simply state that it was one of the presentations that I liked the most giving. In a sense, this talk---and the corresponding paper---encapsulated all the expertise I matured throughout my PhD and my first 2 years as a PostDoc. Indeed, it almost feels like the state-of-practice od ML in the NIDS context had barely progressed since when I first approached this domain---despite thousands of papers revolving around these subjects. Hopefully, our paper will change this.
