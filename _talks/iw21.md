Huaweii organized the first Innovation Workshop on Artificial Intelligence for Cyber-Security, and they invited Prof. Pavel Laskov to give a speech. Unfortunately, Pavel was not able to attend and I had to substitute him. Hopefully the audience liked my talk!

From my end, it was a pleasant experience. In particular, I found fascinating that the attacks I presented (which are extensively described in the paper) were deemed to be "scary" by some of the attendees!
