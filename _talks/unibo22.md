After being appointed as an Assistant Professor (effective September 2022), I was invited by my mentor -- Prof. Michele Colajanni -- to give a seminar talk in the Cybersecurity course (MSc. Degree in Computer Science) at the University of Bologna. 

I accepted the invitation with great pleasure---and I was extremely excited to give such a talk. I left Italy in mid 2020, and had since then stopped collaborating with Prof. Colajanni---who mentored me for 10 years! (My choice of enrolling in the BSc. in Computer Engineering was taken after a conversation I had with him, in 2010.)
Put simply, this talk was the opportunity for me to show my former mentor how much I "grew" in these two years. 

I abstain from judging the talk, but the feedback received by the students was very positive, and Prof. Colajanni also commended the many research ideas that I presented and which I am now pursuing. Yet, I cannot overlook the fact that my current research stems from the "imprinting" that I received as a member of the [WebLab](https://weblab.ing.unimore.it/people/)---and, for this, I will be always thankful to Prof. Colajanni (and my former colleagues).
