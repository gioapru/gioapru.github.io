I loved giving the talk, and the conference was, in general, very good... unfortunately, I was not able to either (a) properly enjoy the conference, and (b) enjoy Hanoi as much as I had wanted.

First, my flight was scheduled to land at 6am on Monday and... well, roughly at the same time, it was expected that a typhoon (yes, a typhoon!) would hit Vietnam. Thankfully, I managed to get to the hotel before getting caught in a huge storm. Yet, my first two days in Hanoi were spent in my hotel room because there was simply too much rain (some people even lost their lives because of the typhoon: [source](https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/typhoon-kajiki-kills-3-vietnam-floods-hanoi-streets-2025-08-26/)).

However, weather aside, the other "problem" was the USENIX Security deadline. Not only I had some papers to submit there (which kept me busy until the very end, but---since I am one of the vice PC chairs---I didn't  have one moment of rest and the moment the deadline hit, I had to focus on dealing with all the "TODOs" that are typical of these circumstances.

The only moments I could (somehow) enjoy Hanoi was the evening of Thursday. I did not go out of my room (not even to attend the conference) until Thursday evening, when I finally had the time to go out and take a walk across the streets. The city is... something worth seeing at least once, I'd say :) (of, and if anyone is reading this and is planning to go to Vietnam: you _must_ try the [Bun cha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bun_cha))
