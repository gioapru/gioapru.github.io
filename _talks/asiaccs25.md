I loved giving the talk, and the conference was, from what I saw, very good... unfortunately, I was not able to enjoy either the conference or Hanoi as much as I had wanted.

First, my flight was scheduled to land at 6am on Monday and... well, roughly at the same time, [it was expected](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/vietnam-plans-mass-evacuation-chinas-sanya-shuts-typhoon-kajiki-intensifies-2025-08-24/) that a typhoon (yes, a [typhoon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhoon)!) would hit Vietnam. Thankfully, I managed to get to the hotel before getting caught in a huge storm. Yet, my first two days in Hanoi were spent in my hotel room because there was simply [too much rain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBFSwY1iIqw) (the typhoon caused [a lot of issues](https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/typhoon-kajiki-kills-3-vietnam-floods-hanoi-streets-2025-08-26/) [in Vietnam](https://www.vietnam-briefing.com/news/aftermath-of-typhoon-kajiki-damage-reports-and-safety-updates.html/) in general).

However, weather aside, the other "problem" was the USENIX Security '26 deadline. Not only I had something to submit there (which kept me busy until the very end), but---since I am one of the vice PC chairs---I didn't have one moment of rest: when the deadline hit, I was "flooded" with all sort of "TODOs" that are typical of these circumstances.

The only moments I could (somehow) enjoy Hanoi was the evening of Thursday. I did not go out of my room (not even to attend the conference) until Thursday evening, when I finally had the time to go out and take a walk across the streets. The city is... something worth seeing at least once, I'd say :) (oh, and if anyone is reading this and is planning to go to Vietnam: you _must_ try the [Bun cha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bun_cha))
