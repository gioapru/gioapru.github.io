I briefly presented my research at this summer school -- during which I met three crucial people for my future career: Prof. Mauro Conti, Prof. Pavel Laskov, Prof. Shanchieh "Jay" Yang.


The simplicity of my presentation was praised by the scientific committee of the PhD School: I was nominated among the recipients of a Student Grant (only 3 participants out of ~30 received such a recognition!).
