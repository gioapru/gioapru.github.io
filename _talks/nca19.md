I came back from my time at Dartmouth on August 4th, and on September 25th I had to take another flight to Boston. Although I was not as stressed as I was the year before (i.e., NCA18 was my first presentation!), this time I had another source of stress.
 
Prof. Mirco Marchetti -- the appointed Financial Chair -- had limited time to do much due to... his wife giving birth! And since we were both members of the [WEBLab](https://weblab.ing.unimore.it/people/), it was only natural that I -- the Ph.D Candidate! -- helped him in his "financial duties" (I had no complaints BTW: he spent a lot of time to "tutor" me during my PhD).

What are these financial duties, you may ask? If I had to say a word, I would choose "things". Think about any conference with some reputation. Now, think about the "things" that are given to you once you arrive at the venue. The <i>bag</i> which contains some <i>leaflets</i> of the program, as well as the <i>USB stick</i> (with an <i>engraving</i>!) containing the <i>proceedings</i>; moreover, the fancier conferences also have <i>pens</i> and <i>block-notes</i> (both with the conference <i>logo</i>). And, of course, the <i>attendee's badge</i>, with its <i>plastic cover</i>.

Well, all those "things" written in <i>italics</i> in the paragraph above... I had to take care of. This means: (i) finding a company that would make them, (ii) ensure that they would ship it to the appointed location and that they would arrive in time, and (iii) do a lot of manual labor to set everything up. You should have seen my face when, 4 days before the start of the conference, I still had no confirmation that the USB sticks had been shipped (from Italy!)...

<b>Takeaway:</b> whenever you are given a plastic badge with your name, spare a thought for the poor guy/girl who manually put that card inside the plastic cover. Also, I now understand why some conference organizers are reluctant to go back to the "physical" conferences: remote ones do not require all such extra effort...
