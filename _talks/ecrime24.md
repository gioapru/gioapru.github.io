Boston, Boston, Boston. After NCA'18, NCA'19, and my time at Dartmouth, this is the fourth time I arrive in Boston---making it the US airport I visited the most (after SFO). This was also the second time I attended the APWG Symposium on Electronic Crime Research (eCrime).

I loved this event. I had this impression last year, which was reinforced this year: the talks and the attendees at eCrime are just something else. As an attendee, I could truly see the willingness in the presenters to "showcase their findings" to "a community that cares about such findings". It felt so genuine, honest---in a sense, "human". I almost wish that all conferences I attend were like this...

Nonetheless, I enjoyed giving the talk of our paper here. Interestingly, this presentation was (similarly to CoG) also a "duo", since I shared the spotlight with Saskia---who did a wonderful job in explaining the various facets of our user study. If you own an Android phone, here's a question for you: do you know what the Google Assistant can do? :)
